# Ayush Verma Portfolio

This is my personal portfolio website built using **React**, **TypeScript**, **Vite**, and **Tailwind CSS**, with animations powered by **Framer Motion**. The site showcases my projects, skills, and provides a way for visitors to contact me. It is fully responsive and works across both desktop and mobile devices.

The portfolio features a **dynamic hero section** with a **typewriter animation** to display my roles and skills, along with **floating animated blobs** in the background. Smooth scroll navigation allows users to easily jump between sections. Each project card displays the technologies used, and includes buttons to view the **live demo** and the **GitHub repository**. The skills section uses **animated circular progress indicators** and interactive hover effects to visually represent my technical expertise.

Additional UI enhancements include a **blinking cursor**, **backdrop blur for intro text**, and responsive animations that adjust based on screen size. This project is deployed on [Netlify](YOUR_DEPLOY_LINK_HERE) and serves as a demonstration of my front-end development capabilities, responsive design, and modern web development practices. It can also be submitted as an assignment to highlight practical experience in **React**, **TypeScript**, **Tailwind CSS**, and **interactive UI design**.
